# Indiumgen.py - Indium Data Generator

## Description
The Indiumgen.py script is designed to generate synthetic data related to driving trips. It simulates various attributes like start and end locations, trip duration, driver details, average speed, impact probability, driving violations, vehicle health, and trip date.

## Dependencies
- Faker
- pandas
- random
- datetime

## Features
- Location Selection: Pre-defined locations in Melbourne, Victoria.
- Impact Probability Calculation: Based on driver score and average speed.
- Data Generation: Generates a dataset with specified attributes.
- File Export: Saves the generated data to CSV and Excel files.

## Usage
Simply run the script to generate the data. You can customize the number of records by modifying the n parameter in the data_gen function.

# IndiumRFC.ipynb - Indium Impact Analysis

## Description
The IndiumRFC.ipynb notebook presents an analysis of the impact prediction model using the data generated by Indiumgen.py. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, model training, and model evaluation.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Sections
- Data Loading: Loading the CSV file generated by Indiumgen.py.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations to showcase relationships between different attributes.
- Model Training: Training a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Insights
- Impact vs Start/End Location: Variations in impact probability.
- Impact vs Driver Score: Clustering around specific scores.
- Impact vs Average Speed: No clear correlation.
- Impact vs Driving Violations: Presence of violations increases impact probability.

## Usage
Open the notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis. You can modify the specific route details to predict the probability of impact for different scenarios.
