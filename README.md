# Indium Impact Predictor
Indium Impact Predictor is a specialized solution designed for an artificial driving courier company named Indium. Utilizing a synthetic dataset generated with the `indiumGen.py` file within the `Model+DataGenerator` folder, it simulates real-world scenarios for the courier service. The dataset, crafted using the Faker library, encodes relationships across various attributes, including:

- **Start Location:** The starting point of the trip.
- **End Location:** The destination of the trip.
- **Start Time:** The time the trip begins.
- **End Time:** The time the trip concludes.
- **Trip Duration:** The total time taken for the trip.
- **Driver Name:** The name of the driver.
- **Driver Score:** A rating assigned to the driver.
- **Average Speed (km/hr):** The average speed maintained during the trip.
- **Impact:** Whether an impact occurred during the trip.
- **Driving Violations:** Any violations committed by the driver.
- **Vehicle Health:** The health status of the vehicle.
- **Trip Date:** The date of the trip.

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the generated dataset to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of an impact during a trip. Various factors contribute to this prediction, and the Random Forest Classifier has been employed to analyze these relationships and provide accurate predictions.

By understanding and predicting the likelihood of impacts, Indium can enhance safety measures, optimize routes, and improve overall operational efficiency. The Indium Impact Predictor serves as a valuable tool in achieving these objectives, reflecting a commitment to innovation and excellence in the courier service industry.

## Indiumgen.py - Indium Data Generator

### Description
The Indiumgen.py script is designed to generate synthetic data related to driving trips. It simulates various attributes like start and end locations, trip duration, driver details, average speed, impact probability, driving violations, vehicle health, and trip date.

### Dependencies
- Faker
- pandas
- random
- datetime

### Features
- Location Selection: Pre-defined locations in Melbourne, Victoria.
- Impact Probability Calculation: Based on driver score and average speed.
- Data Generation: Generates a dataset with specified attributes.
- File Export: Saves the generated data to CSV and Excel files.

### Usage
Simply run the script to generate the data. You can customize the number of records by modifying the n parameter in the data_gen function.

## IndiumRFC.ipynb - Indium Impact Analysis

### Description
The IndiumRFC.ipynb notebook presents an analysis of the impact prediction model using the data generated by Indiumgen.py. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, model training, and model evaluation.

### Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Sections
- Data Loading: Loading the CSV file generated by Indiumgen.py.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations to showcase relationships between different attributes.
- Model Training: Training a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Insights
- Impact vs Start/End Location: Variations in impact probability.
- Impact vs Driver Score: Clustering around specific scores.
- Impact vs Average Speed: No clear correlation.
- Impact vs Driving Violations: Presence of violations increases impact probability.

### Usage
Open the notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis. You can modify the specific route details to predict the probability of impact for different scenarios.
